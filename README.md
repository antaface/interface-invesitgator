## 🕵️ Interface Investigator

An interactive UX-mystery game built using Lovable’s React + Vite + TypeScript stack — by a designer with no coding background.

It’s part branching narrative game, part portfolio piece, part satire of bad UI patterns. Features include:

- Supabase chat API for scene logic
- Tailwind + shadcn/ui styling
- All logic and components built through AI pair programming via Lovable
- A whole lot of design jokes and UX easter eggs
